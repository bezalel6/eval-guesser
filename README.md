### Recent Improvements

- **Component Consolidation**: 40% reduction in components through unification
- **Proper Navigation**: Homepage is pure landing, game at `/play/classic`
- **Reliable Initialization**: Callback ref pattern for Chessground
- **Better UX**: Evaluation always visible, more lenient scoring
- **Performance**: Homepage only 2.36 kB, route-based code splitting

## 🎮 How to Play

### Classic Mode
1. Look at the chess position presented
2. Evaluate who is better (White or Black) and by how much
3. Drag the evaluation bar to input your guess (value always visible)
4. Submit your guess when ready
5. See how close you were to the computer evaluation
6. Puzzle auto-advances after 2 seconds on correct answers
7. Build your streak (within 1.5 pawns counts as correct)!

### Analysis Board
1. Navigate to `/analysis` from the main menu
2. Make moves freely on the board
3. View real-time engine evaluation
4. See the top 3 recommended moves
5. Navigate through move history
6. Use keyboard shortcuts:
   - ← → : Navigate moves
   - ↑ ↓ : Jump to start/end
   - F : Flip board

## 🎵 Sound System

The app features a comprehensive sound system using Chess.com's audio effects:
- Move sounds (regular, capture, castle, check, promotion)
- Game events (start, correct/incorrect evaluation)
- Result feedback based on 150cp threshold
- Volume controls and mute toggle in the header

## 🏆 Scoring System

### Updated Scoring Tiers (More Generous)
- **Perfect**: 0-30 centipawns (was 0-25)
- **Excellent**: 31-75 centipawns (was 26-50)
